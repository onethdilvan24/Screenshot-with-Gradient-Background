# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following PNG icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:

1. **Online Generators:**
   - [Chrome Extension Icon Generator](https://chrome-extension-icon-generator.vercel.app/)
   - [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/)

2. **Design Tools:**
   - Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or any image editor
   - Export as PNG with transparent background

3. **Simple Placeholder:**
   - Use a simple camera icon or screenshot symbol
   - Keep it minimal and recognizable at small sizes

## Icon Guidelines

- Use PNG format with transparency
- Keep design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use consistent colors and style across all sizes
- Consider the extension's purpose (screenshot tool)

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can create simple colored squares as placeholders until proper icons are designed.
